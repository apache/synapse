======================================================
Apache Synapse M1 build  (January, 2006)

http://incubator.apache.org/synapse/
------------------------------------------------------

Synapse is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Web Services PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects 
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process 
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has 
yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Documentation
===================
 
Documentation can be found in the 'docs' directory included with the 
binary distribution and in the 'xdocs' directory in the source 
distribution.

-------------------
Getting Started
===================

Synapse is configured using the synapse.xml file in the repository directory. 
In the binary distribution this is the <SYNAPSE>\synapse_repository directory, where
<SYNAPSE> is the directory you installed SYNAPSE to. 

You can start Synapse using the bin\synapse command (bat or sh)

Synapse allows you to mediate Web Service messages. For examples please see the User Guide
(http://wiki.apache.org/ws/Synapse/UserGuide). 

There are three simple stockquote clients that demonstrate Synapse as a mediation engine 
in the samples\userguide directory.
