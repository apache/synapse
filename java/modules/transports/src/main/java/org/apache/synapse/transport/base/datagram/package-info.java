/**
 * Base classes for datagram transports.
 * <p>
 * A datagram type transport is a transport that entirely reads a message
 * into memory before starting to process it: in contrast to transports like HTTP,
 * it doesn't support streaming. This approach can be chosen either because
 * of the characteristics of the underlying protocol (such as in the case of UDP)
 * or because streaming a message would unnecessarily delay the processing of the
 * next available message (as in the case of a UNIX pipe).
