This specifies the guidelines on adding new sample configurations and also this describes
the structure in which synapse samples are ordered in.
=========================================================================================

0-50        ==> Simple straight forward message mediation tasks using basic mediators and
                introduction to the core concepts of Synapse
50-100      ==> Advanced mediations with endpoints (load-balancing/failover etc...)
100-150     ==> Quality of Service addition or deduction samples in message mediation
150-200     ==> Basic proxy service samples
200-250     ==> QoS addition and deduction for service mediation (proxy) samples
250-300     ==> Transport switching and transport introduction samples
300-350     ==> Task samples (can be advanced mediations)
350 upwards ==> Advanced mediations with advanced mediators (db, xquery, throttle, cache, clone,
                etc...) using either message mediation or service mediation appropriately.
