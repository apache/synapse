Building Synapse from Source

The Synapse source code is available at http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/incubator/synapse/trunk/java/

To build Synapse, you will need JDK 1.4.x or 1.5.x., Maven 2 and any of its dependencies.

The Synapse JARs could be built with maven 2 as follows:

mvn clean install

Note: If you encounter any issues with Maven 2 complaining of invalid POMs refer to this ->

To build the Synapse distribution, use the following:

mvn assembly:assembly -Drelease

This will build the source and binary distributions in the target folder.

To build the site, use:

mvn site
