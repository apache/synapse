Building Synapse from Source

The Synapse source code is available at http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/incubator/synapse/trunk/java/

To build Synapse, you will need JDK 1.4.x or 1.5.x., Maven and any of its dependencies.

The Synapse distribution could be built with the maven target "dist-bin" as follows:

maven clean dist-bin

The binary would be available at target\dist

Build the extensions after you perform a "dist-bin" and perform it using the "dist-extensions" target
without specifying "clean", as follows:

maven dist-extensions

The binary would be available at target\dist

Note:

As the build process executes the unit test cases, you will need to set up your build environment to 
support the extensions. 

The Validate mediator depends on the Xerces 2.8.0 parser, and this should be installed into your
JAVA/lib/endorsed directory. 
(e.g. C:\jdk1.5.0_06\jre\lib\endorsed and may not be to C:\jdk1.5.0_06\lib\endorsed if you have the JRE)

You will need the xml-apis.jar, and the xercesImpl.jar copied to the lib\endorsed directory at a mimimum.

You may optionally ignore unit test failures with the "maven.test.failure.ignore" property. Refer to 
http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/plugins/test/properties.html for more information.
