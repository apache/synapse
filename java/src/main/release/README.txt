Apache Synapse 1.0 build  (May 2007) - http://ws.apache.org/synapse/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------
First Steps
===================

Once you extract the downloaded binary distribution, it will create the following directory
structure.

	synapse
		/bin
			synapse.sh
			synapse.bat
		/docs
			<documentation>
		/lib
			<libraries>
			log4j.properties
		/repository
			/conf
				synapse.xml
				axis2.xml
			/sample
				<sample configuration files>
				/resources
					<sample resources>
		/samples
			/axis2Client
				<ant script to run sample clients>
			/axis2Server
				axis2Server.sh
				axis2Server.bat
				/src/
					<sample services source>


You could start Synapse using the bin/synapse.sh or bin/synapse.bat script, which will load 
the configuration found in repository/conf/synapse.xml. To configure the underlying Axis2
SOAP engine (e.g. to enable JMS) you need to configure the repository/conf/axis2.xml. To 
configure logging levels and to turn on/off debug level logging, please configure the 
lib/log4j.properties file, and set the line "log4j.category.org.apache.synapse=INFO" as
"log4j.category.org.apache.synapse=DEBUG" to turn on debug logging.

-------------------

and in the 'src/site/resources' directory in the source distribution.
