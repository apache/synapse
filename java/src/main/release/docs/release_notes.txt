Apache Synapse 1.1 Release Notes

1. Overview
    The Synapse project is a robust, lightweight implementation of a highly scalable and distributed
    service mediation framework based on Web services and XML specifications.

    Apache Synapse graduated from the Apache Incubator on the 2nd of January 2007
    Please see http://ws.apache.org/synapse/ for more information

    The first Synapse 1.0 was released on the 11th of June 2007

2. Installation Prerequisites 

    Apache Synapse requires a J2SE runtime of version 1.5.x or later and Apache Ant to run the samples.
    Synapse requires JDK 1.5.x at runtime as it uses a NIO based https implementation, that is only
    possible with a JDK 1.5.x or later. To build Synapse from source, you will need JDK 1.5.x, and
    Apache Maven 2.0.6

3. Quick start
    Please see the docs/Synapse_Quickstart.html guide

4. Building the Samples
    Please see the documents docs/Synapse_Samples.html and docs/Synapse_Samples_Setup.html

5. Synapse configuration language
    Please see the document docs/Synapse_Configuration_Language.html

6. Extending Synapse
    Please see the document docs/Synapse_Extending.html
    
7. Known Issues and limitations

    SYNAPSE-174 - The non-blocking http/s transports cannot handle WS-RM requests
        - Caused by the NIO http/s transport being out of sync with the latest Sandesh2 codebase

    SYNAPSE-170 - VFS transport listener sample - In the response sent via email, all tags define the same namespace
        - Caused by an Axis2 Mail transport limitation

    SYNAPSE-161 - Can't persuade Rampart to send certificate serial + issuer - only either BinaryToken or Identity
        - Issue related to Apache Rampart
        
    SYNAPSE-103 - WS-RM not returning response message
        - related to SYNAPSE-174

    The Synapse JMS implementation supports JMS 1.0.2b, however due to licensing issues we include
    the JMS 1.1 spec JAR from Apache Geronimo (geronimo-jms_1.1_spec-1.1.jar) instead. If you have
    any issues with JMS 1.0.x, please download the Sun JMS 1.0.2b JAR and replace supplied JAR from
    Geronimo.

8. Frequently asked questions

  * How can I change the default logging level of Synapse?
    Edit the lib/log4j.properties and set the line "log4j.category.org.apache.synapse=INFO" to
    "log4j.category.org.apache.synapse=DEBUG" and restart Synapse.

  * If you get an error related to WS-Security or when using it, check to ensure that your JDK
    uses the "Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files". These could be downloaded from
    http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp Refer to the associated documentation
    for instructions on how to install it to your JDK.

  * If you encounter issues with your JDK related to XML processing, try placing the Xerces jar
    files xercesImpl-2.8.0.jar and xml-apis-1.3.03.jar in your <JDK>/jre/lib/endorsed/ directory.
