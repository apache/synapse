Apache Synapse 0.90 Release Notes

1. Overview
Apache Synapse is a highly flexible XML router and mediator that can be the basis of your SOA infrastructure. 

Apache Synapse is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. 
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
