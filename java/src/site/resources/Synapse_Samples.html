<h1>Running the Synapse Samples</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>To run the samples bundled with the Synapse distribution you will need Ant
1.5 or later. Ant can be downloaded from http://ant.apache.org. The samples
now come with a built in Axis2 server to host the service endpoints used in
the samples, along with simple ant scripts to build and deploy the services
into this Axis2 instance.</p>

<h2>Starting Axis2</h2>

<p>To start the bundled Axis2 server, go to the samples/axis2Server directory
and execute the axis2server.sh or axis2server.bat script. This starts the
Axis2 server with the HTTP transport listner on port 9000.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The sample services are available in the samples/axis2Server/src
directory. To deploy these services go the the selected directory and run
'ant'. This will build the service archive file (aar) and deploy it into the
Axis2 server. (i.e. copy it to the
samples/axis2Server/repository\services)</p>

<p></p>

<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>To deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService service go to the samples/axis2Server/src/SimpleStockQuoteService and execute 'ant' without any arguments as follows:</pre>
<pre>C:\Java\SynapseDist\synapse-0.90-SNAPSHOT\samples\axis2Server\src\SimpleStockQuoteService&gt;ant</pre>
<pre>Buildfile: build.xml</pre>
<pre>...</pre>
<pre>[jar] Building jar: C:\Java\SynapseDist\synapse-0.90-SNAPSHOT\samples\axis2Server\repository</pre>
<pre>\services\SimpleStockQuoteService.aar</pre>
<pre>BUILD SUCCESSFUL</pre>

<p></p>

<h2>Descriptions of sample Services</h2>

<p>1. SimpleStockQuoteService</p>

<p>This service has two operations, getQuote (in/out) and placeOrder
(in-only). It will generate a sample stock quote for a given symbol.</p>

<p></p>

<p>2. SimpleStockQuoteService1 - This has the same functionality as the
SimpleStockQuoteService service, but exists to make available a different
service instance/EPR to demonstrating routing</p>

<p></p>

<p>3. SimpleStockQuoteService2 - Same as the SimpleStockQuoteService2 (Refer
above) </p>

<p></p>

<p>4. SecureStockQuoteService1 - Simple stock quote service using WS-Security
with timestamps and username token authentication</p>

<p><br>
5. SecureStockQuoteService3 - Stock quote service using WS-Security
signatures and encryption</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Starting Synapse</h2>

<p>To start Synapse with the default configuration execute the synapse.bat or
synapse.sh script in the bin directory. This starts up an instance of Synapse
using the Synapse and Axis2 configuration files located at repository/conf</p>

<p></p>

<p>To start specific sample configurations of Synapse, use the -sample
&lt;number&gt; switch as follows:</p>

<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>bin\synapse.bat -sample &lt;number&gt; on a Windows system will use the sample synapse.xml</pre>

<p>configuration file located at
repository\conf\sample\synapse_sample_&lt;number&gt;.xml</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Invoking the sample clients</h2>

<p>The clients are located in the samples/axis2Client directory, and should
be executed with the ant script supplied. (e.g. ant stockquote) The ant
script expects an argument to select the client scenario to be executed. The
samples/axis2Client/client_repo directory contains an Axis2 client repository
along with the necessary modules and dependencies to make available
WS-Addressing, WS-Security (Rampart) and WS-Reliable Messaging (Sandesha2) on
the client side.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Sample Scenarios</h1>

<h2>Sample 0:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to Synapse. Shows how a message could be
made to pass through Synapse </strong><strong>and logged before it is
delivered to its ultimate receiver.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>A client could interact with Synapse in one of three modes as follows:</p>

<p></p>

<h3>1. Smart Client mode</h3>

<p>In this mode, the client addresses its messages to the ultimate receiver
of the message using WS-Addressing, but specifies the transport URL to
Synapse. This results in the messages reaching Synapse with the WS-Addressing
information which could be used to route the message as appropriate.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>2. Synapse as a Proxy</h3>

<p>In this mode, the client sets Synapse as an HTTP Proxy but sets the
destination EPR to indicate the ultimate receiver of the message. This forces
all outgoing HTTP messages to flow into Synapse, which will then send the
messages as appropriate.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>3. Dumb Client</h3>

<p>In this mode, the client expects Synapse to decide on the destination of
the message through appropriate routing rules using the content of the
message.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 0: i.e. synapse -sample 0</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Execute the Smart Client as 'ant stockquote'</strong></p>

<p>Client: samples.userguide.StockQuoteClient</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you follow through the execution of Synapse mediation rules while
looking at the configuration used synapse_sample_0.xml you will notice that
the client request arrived at Synapse with a WS-Addressing 'To' EPR of
http://localhost:9000/axis2/services/SimpleStockQuoteService</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Synapse configuration logs the message at the highest log level as the
configuration specifies the log level as 'full'. Then Synapse sends the
message using the implicit 'To' address of the message - which is
http://localhost:9000/axis2/services/SimpleStockQuoteService</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then you will see on the Axis2 server console, a message similar to the
following</p>
<pre>Sat Nov 18 21:01:23 IST 2006 SimpleStockQuoteService :: Generating quote for : IBM</pre>

<p></p>

<p>This shows that Synapse forwarded the message to the intended recepient
after logging the message and then the actual service received and processed
it. The response message generated is again received at Synapse, and flows
through the same mediation rules, which logs the message and then sends it -
this time back to the client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the client console you should see an output similar to the following
based on the message received by the client.</p>
<pre>Standard :: Stock price = $95.26454380258552</pre>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Execute the Proxy client as 'ant proxystockquote'</strong></p>

<p>Client: samples.userguide.ProxyStockQuoteClient</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will see the exact same behaviour as per the previous example when you
run this scenario. However this time the difference is at the client and
would be noticable only if one looks at the source code of the example class
samples.userguide.ProxyStockQuoteClient</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Execute the Proxy client as 'ant proxystockquote'</strong></p>

<p>Client: samples.userguide.ProxyStockQuoteClient</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will see the exact same behaviour as per the previous example when you
run this scenario. However this time the difference is at the client and
would be noticable only if one looks at the source code of the example class
samples.userguide.ProxyStockQuoteClient</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 1:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to simple content based routing. Shows how
a message could be made to pass through Synapse using the Dumb Client mode,
where Synapse acts as a gateway to accept all messages and then perform
mediation and routing.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 1: i.e. synapse -sample 1</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Execute the Dumb Client as 'ant dumbstockquote'</p>

<p>Client: samples.userguide.DumbStockQuoteClient</p>

<p></p>

<p>This time you will notice that Synapse received a message for which
Synapse was set as the ultimate receiver of the message. Based on the 'To'
EPR, Synapse performed a match to the given path '/StockQuote' and as the
request matched the XPath expression of the filter mediator, the filter
mediators' child mediators executes, and thereby semding the message to a
different endpoint as specified by the [reusable] endpoint definition.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 2:</h2>

<p>Objective: Introduce switch-case mediator and writing and reading of local
properties on a message</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 2: i.e. synapse -sample 2</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Execute the 'ant stockquote' request again, and by following through the
mediation rules executed you will see that the case statements' first case
for 'IBM' executed and a local property named 'symbol' was set to 'Great
stock - IBM'. Subsequently this local property value is looked up by the log
mediator and logged. The message flowes through to Axis2 and then the reply
back to the client.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 3:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Illustrates simple properties, and reusable endpoints
and sequences</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 3: i.e. synapse -sample 3</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Execute the 'ant stockquote' request again. Following through the
mediation logs you will see that once the filter and switch statments are
through, the sequence named 'stockquote' is referenced and invoked. Also the
log mediator dumps a string property, and two XPath evaluation results. The
first expression fetches a local static string lieral property named
'version'. This is a global property applicable to all messages passing
through Synapse, and available for reading from any reusable sequence or the
main rules. The second expression fetches the local message property named
'symbol' which was set within the switch mediator, using the set-property
mediator. However, for both expressions the 'get-property()' XPath extension
function has been used. This function will first look for a given property
within the local message, and if a property with the name cannot be found, it
performs a lookup over all global properties. In addition, the get-property()
function supports the special cases 'To', 'From', 'Action', 'FaultTo' and
'ReplyTo', which fetches the appropriate values from the current message
context.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 4:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to error handling with the try and
makefault mediators</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 4: i.e. synapse -sample 4</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you execute 'ant stockquote', the default stock symbol queried is
'IBM'. However you could use the 'symbol' system property and pass it into
the above (e.g. ant stockquote -Dsymbol=MSFT) to query another symbol.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When the IBM stock quote is requested, the configuration routes it to the
endpoint defined as the 'simple' endpoint, which routes the message to the
SimpleStockQuoteService on the local Axis2 instance. Hence a valid response
message is shown at the client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you lookup a stock quote for 'MSFT', Synapse is instructed to route the
message to the endpoint defined as the 'bogus' endpoint, which tries to
deliver the message to a non existing service. Hence the method encounters a
connection exception, which gets handled by the enclosing try mediator. When
an error is encountered within the scope of a try mediator, it executes the
mediation logic specified in its 'onError' segment. In this example, the
sequence named 'errorHandler' is invoked, and it logs the error message as
well as the error detail, and then creates a custom fault message reading the
property named 'ERROR_MESSAGE' which is set on the current message by the try
mediator on encountering an exception. At the client end, you would see the
custom SOAP fault message instead of a stock quote.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 5:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to error handling within a sequence using
the 'onError' sequence</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 5: i.e. synapse -sample 5</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>This sample demonstrates the ability to assign an existing sequence as the
error handling sequence of another. The 'onError' attribute of a sequence
calls on the named sequence specified when an exception is encountered during
the processing. You could request for IBM and MSFT quotes using the same
client and experience the same behaviour from Synapse.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 6:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to header, in and out
mediators</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 6: i.e. synapse -sample 6</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService1 (Refer
steps above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this example we use the same stockquote client which sets the 'To' EPR
of the message to the SimpleStockQuoteService service. However, if this
request is for the IBM stock, the configuration invokes the header mediator
and sets the 'To' value to the SimpleStockQuoteService1. Hence if you request
for the IBM stock, you should see the header mediator changing the
WS-Addressing header in the log message, and on the Axis2 server console you
would notice that the SimpleStockQuoteService1 service indeed received and
processed the response. You will also see that the mediation rules now use
the in and out mediators - which executes the mediators within them depending
on whether the message is an incoming request from a client, or a response
message being sent to a client from Synapse. The log message 'sending back
the response' prints only during the processing of the response message.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If a request is made for any other stock, Synapse is instructed to drop
the message and hence the client will not receive any response. The drop
mediator aborts further processing of a message and may be used to discard
and reject unwanted messages.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 7:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to the extension mediators, static XML
properties and the validate mediator</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Download Xerces2-j 2.8.0 or later, and copy the xml-apis.jar and
xercesImpl.jar into the lib/endorsed folder</p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 7: i.e. synapse -sample 7</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>The validate mediator is bundled as an extension mediator as it depends on
the Xerces2-j parser for schema validation, to keep the core Synapse
distribution compact. Hence to try this example you will first need to
download the Xerces parser and place its jar files into the lib folder to
make it available to the validate mediator.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This example shows how an XML fragment could be made available to Synapse
as a property. Such a property is called an inline XML property and is static
since its content never changes after initiation. Hence a Schema is made
available to the configuration as a property named 'validate_schema'.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Synapse supports string, inline text, inline xml and URL source properties
which are static properties. In addition it supports dynamic registry based
properties as introduced later.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this example the request messages are filtered using a boolean XPath
expression which checks if the request is a getQuote request. If so the
'customsequence' sequence is invoked, which in-turn calls on the validate
mediator passing it the property key 'validate_schema'. The validate mediator
by default operates on the first child element of the SOAP body. You may
specify an XPath expression using an attribute 'source' to override this
behaviour. The validate mediator now uses the 'validate_schema' property to
validate the incoming message, and if the message is in error invokes on the
'on-fail' sequence of mediators.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you send a standard stockquote request using 'ant stockquote' you will
now get a fault back with a message 'Invalid custom quote request' as the
schema validation failed. This is because the schema used in the example
expects a slightly different message than what is created by the stock quote
client. (i.e. expects a 'stocksymbol' element instead of 'symbol' to specify
thestock symbol)</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 8:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to URL source properties, registry based
properties and the XSLT mediator</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Download Xalan-J version 2.7.0 or later, and copy xalan.jar and
serializer.jar into the Synapse lib folder. Copy xercesImpl.jar and
xml-apis.jar (of Xerces-J) into the lib/endorsed folder.</p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 8: i.e. synapse -sample 8</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>This example uses the XSLT mediator to perform transformations, and the
xslt tranformation is specified as a property, similar to the way the a
schema was specified to the validate mediator. The first resource
'xslt-key-req' is specified by specifying its URL. The URL could be any valid
URL, for e.g. http://someserver/path/resource.xslt or a file:// URL etc. The
second resource 'xslt-key-resp' is specified using a 'key' attribute.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this example you will notice the new 'registry' definition. Synapse
comes with a simple URL based registry called SimpleURLRegistry. During
initialization of the registry, the SimpleURLRegistry expects to find a
property named 'root', which specifies a prefix for the registry keys used
later. When the SimpleURLRegistry is used, this root is prefixed to the
property key to form the complete URL for the resource being looked up. The
registry caches a resource once requested, and caches it internally for a
specified duration. Once this period expires, it will reload the meta
information about the resource and reload its cached copy if required, the
next time the resource is requested.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Hence the second XSLT resource key 'transform/transform_back.xslt'
concatenated with the 'root' of the SimpleUTLRegistry
'file:repository/conf/sample/resources/' forms the complete URL of the
resource as
'file:repository/conf/sample/resources/transform/transform_back.xslt' and
caches its value for a period of 15000 seconds.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Execute the custom quote client as 'ant customquote' and check analyze the
the Synapse debug log output as shown below</p>

<p></p>
<pre>DEBUG XSLTMediator - Transformation source :</pre>
<pre>&lt;m0:CheckPriceRequest xmlns:m0="http://www.apache-synapse.org/test"&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;m0:Code&gt;IBM&lt;/m0:Code&gt;&lt;/m0:CheckPriceRequest&gt;</pre>
<pre>DEBUG XSLTMediator - Transformation result :</pre>
<pre>&lt;m:getQuote xmlns:m="http://services.samples/xsd"&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;m:request&gt;&lt;m:symbol&gt;IBM&lt;/m:symbol&gt;&lt;/m:request&gt;&lt;/m:getQuote&gt;</pre>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The incoming message is now transformed into a standard stock quote
request as expected by the SimpleStockQuoteService deployed on the local
Axis2 instance by the XSLT mediator. The XSLT mediator uses Xalan-J to
perform the transformations, and hence the necessary Xalan-J and Xerces-J
libraries needs to be made available to Synapse. The response from the
SimpleStockQuoteService is converted into the custom format as expected by
the client during the out message processing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>During the response processing you could notice the SimpleURLRegistry
fetching the resource as shown by the debug logs below</p>

<p></p>
<pre>INFO SimpleURLRegistry - ==&gt; Repository fetch of resource with key : transform/transform_back.xslt</pre>

<p></p>

<p>If you re-run the client again immidiately (i.e within 15 seconds of the
first request) you will not see the resource being re-loaded by the registry
as the cached value would be still valid.</p>

<p></p>

<p>However if you leave the system idle for 15 seconds or more and then retry
the same request, you will now notice that the registry noticed the cache
expiry and checked the meta information about the resource to check if the
resource itself has changes and requires a fresh fetch from the source
URL.</p>

<p></p>
<pre>DEBUG AbstractRegistry - Cached object has expired for key : transform/transransform_back.xslt</pre>
<pre>DEBUG SimpleURLRegistry - Perform RegistryEntry lookup for key : transform/transform_back.xslt</pre>
<pre>DEBUG AbstractRegistry - Expired version number is same as current version in registry</pre>
<pre>DEBUG AbstractRegistry - Renew cache lease for another 15s</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Now edit the
repository/conf/sample/resources/transform/transform_back.xslt file and add a
blank line at the end. Now when you run the client again, and if the cache is
expired, the resource would be re-fetched from its URL by the registry and
this can be seen by the following debug log messages</p>

<p></p>
<pre>DEBUG AbstractRegistry - Cached object has expired for key : transform/transform_back.xslt</pre>
<pre>DEBUG SimpleURLRegistry - Perform RegistryEntry lookup for key : transform/transform_back.xslt</pre>
<pre>INFO SimpleURLRegistry - ==&gt; Repository fetch of resource with key : transform/transform_back.xslt</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Thus the SimpleURLRegistry allows resource to be cached, and updates
detected so that changes could be reloaded without restarting the Synapse
instance.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Proxy services</h1>

<h2>Sample 100:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to Synapse proxy services</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 100: i.e. synapse -sample 100</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once Synapse starts, you could go to
http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteProxy?wsdl and view the WSDL
for the proxy service defined in the configuration. This WSDL is based on the
source WSDL supplied in the proxy service definition, and is updated to
reflect the proxy service EPR. If a proxy service definition does not specify
a target for its messages, the Synapse mediation rules are applied to route
messages.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Execute the stock quote client by requesting for a stock quote on the
proxy service as follows:</p>
<pre>ant stockquote -Durl=http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteProxy</pre>

<p></p>

<p>You will now notice that the Synapse mediation rules were applied and the
request was routed to the SimpleStockQuoteService service on the local Axis2
instance. The response message is mediated using the same rules, as an
outgoing sequence is not specified in this example either. The client should
receive a stock quote reply from the proxy service. Also the client could get
the WSDL for the proxy service by requesting for
http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteProxy?wsdl</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 101:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Using custom sequences and endpoints for message
mediation with proxy services</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 101: i.e. synapse -sample 101</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>This configuration creates two proxy services with different behaviour.
The first proxy service 'StockQuoteProxy1' uses the sequence named 'proxy_1'
as its main mediation sequence for messages it receives. The second proxy
service 'StockQuoteProxy2' is set to directly forward messages that are
received to the endpoint named 'proxy_2_endpoint' without any mediation.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You could send a stock quote request to each of these proxy services and
receive the reply generated by the actual service hosted on the Axis2
instance. Use the -Durl=&lt;EPR&gt; property when executing the client as per
example 100, to request on the two proxy services.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 102:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Attaching service level WS-Security policies to proxy
services</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 102: i.e. synapse -sample 102</p>

<p>Copy the Apache Rampart module (e.g. rampart-1.1-SNAPSHOT.mar) into the
modules directories of both the sample Axis2 client and server:
samples/axis2Client/client_repo/modules and
samples/axis2Server/repository/modules. The Rampart module could be found at
repository\modules and is not duplicated in the distributions due to its
large file size.</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>To execute the sample use the stock quote client with the 'secpolicy' and
'url' system properties passed in as follows:</p>

<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>ant stockquote -Durl=http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteProxy</pre>
<pre>-Dsecpolicy=..\..\repository\conf\sample\resources\policy\policy_1.xml</pre>

<p></p>

<p>The sample security policy policy_1.xml uses timestamps and username token
tuhentication on the stock quote request. Following the debug logs on the
Synapse server you could notice the presence of WS-Security headers on the
incoming message. By requesting the WSDL of the proxy service you could also
see that the supplied policy file has been attached to the specified WSDL as
well.</p>

<p>e.g. http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteProxy?wsdl</p>

<p></p>

<p>A proxy service with an attached policy - such as a WS-Security policy -
ensures that messages which goes through mediation have satisfied the
constraints as specified by the supplied policy. i.e. for example, if any
WS-Security validations fail, the message will not reach Synapse mediation,
but the client would get an appropriate error message from the Apache Rampart
module directly.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The mediation shows the header mediator used to strip out the
wsse:Security header from the current message before being forwarded to the
SimpleStockQuoteService. Hence the message sent to the stock quote service
EPR is without any WS-Security headers as can be seen from the log
messages.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: If you wish to engage the default WS-Security policy of Rampart on a
proxy service, you could use the &lt;enableSec/&gt; option on a proxy service
alone. This will be similar in function to 'engaging' Rampart on an Axis2
service.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 103:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Using WS-Security signing and encryption with proxy
services through WS-Policy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Download and copy the BouncyCastle JAR file into your Synapse lib
directory. (Note: the exact JAR you need to install depends on your JDK - for
JDK 1.4 I have used bcprov-jdk13-132.jar)</p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 103: i.e. synapse -sample 103</p>

<p>Copy the Apache Rampart module (e.g. rampart-1.1-SNAPSHOT.mar) into the
modules directory of the sample Axis2 client
samples/axis2Client/client_repo/modules. The Rampart module could be found at
repository\modules and is not duplicated within the distributions due to its
large file size.</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p></p>

<p>To execute the sample use the dumb stock quote client with the 'secpolicy'
and 'gatewayurl' system properties passed in as follows:</p>

<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>ant dumbstockquote -Dsecpolicy=..\..\repository\conf\sample\resources\policy\client_policy_3.xml</pre>
<pre>-Dgatewayurl=http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteProxy</pre>

<p></p>

<p>The sample security policy client_policy_3.xml ensures signed and
encrypted messages which request for the stock quotes. Following the debug
logs on the Synapse server you could notice the presence of WS-Security
headers on the incoming message. By requesting the WSDL of the proxy service
you could also see that the supplied policy file has been attached to the
specified WSDL as well.</p>

<p>e.g. http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteProxy?wsdl</p>

<p></p>

<p>By following through the Synapse log messages you could see that the proxy
service received and decrypted the secured SOAP envelope. (If you sent the
client request to Synapse through a TCP monitor you would be able to see the
raw encrypted message in transit) and forwarded this to the simple stockquote
service, and once the response was received, signed it and encrypted it
before sending it back to the client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Using TCPMon, a sample request sent from the client to the WS-Security
enabled proxy service has been captured as follows:</p>

<p><a href="sample_103_1.txt">sample_103_1.txt</a></p>

<p>Synapse removes the wsse:Security header from this message and forwards it
to the endpoint. The response received is now signed and encrypted and sent
back to the client as follows:</p>

<p><a href="sample_103_2.txt">sample_103_2.txt</a></p>

<h2>Sample 110:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Introduction to switching transports with proxy
services</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p>Download, install and start a JMS server, and configure Synapse to listen
on JMS (refer notes below)</p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 110: i.e. synapse -sample 110</p>

<p></p>

<p>For this example we would use ActiveMQ as the JMS provider. Once ActiveMQ
is installed and started you should get a message as follows:</p>
<pre>INFO BrokerService - ActiveMQ JMS Message Broker (localhost) started</pre>

<p></p>

<p>You will now need to configure the Axis2 instance used by Synapse (not the
sample Axis2 server) to enable JMS support using the above provider. Refer to
the Axis2 documentation on setting up JMS for more details
(http://ws.apache.org/axis2/1_1/jms-transport.html). You will also need to
copy the ActiveMQ client jar files activeio-core-3.0-beta1.jar,
activemq-core-4.0-RC2.jar and geronimo-j2ee-management_1.0_spec-1.0.jar into
the lib directory to allow Synapse to connect to the JMS provider.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For a default ActiveMQ v4.0 installation, you may uncomment the Axis2
transport listener configuration found at repository/conf/axis2.xml as</p>
<pre>&lt;transportReceiver name="jms" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.jms.JMSListener"&gt; ...</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Once you start the Synapse configuration and request for the WSDL of the
proxy service you will notice that its exposed only on the JMS transport.
This is because the configuration specified this requirement in the proxy
service definition.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now lets send a stock quote request on JMS, using the dumb stock quote
client as follows:</p>
<pre>ant dumbstockquote -Dgatewayurl="jms:/StockQuoteProxy?transport.jms.ConnectionFactoryJNDIName=</pre>
<pre>QueueConnectionFactory&amp;java.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.jndi.</pre>
<pre>ActiveMQInitialContextFactory&amp;java.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:61616"</pre>

<p></p>

<p>On the Synapse debug log you will notice that the JMS listener received
the request message as:</p>
<pre>[JMSWorker-1] DEBUG ProxyServiceMessageReceiver -</pre>
<pre>Proxy Service StockQuoteProxy received a new message...</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Synapse forwarded this message to the HTTP EPR of the simple stock quote
service hosted on the sample Axis2 server, and returned the reply back to the
client through a JMS temporary queue.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: It is possible to instruct a JMS proxy service to listen to an
already existing destination without creating a new one. To do this, use the
property elements on the proxy service definition to specify the destination
and connection factory etc.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>&lt;property name="transport.jms.Destination" value="dynamicTopics/something.TestTopic"/&gt;</pre>

<p></p>

<h2>Sample 111:</h2>

<p><strong>Objective: Demonstrate switching from HTTP to JMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pre-Requisites:</strong></p>

<p>Download, install and start a JMS server, and configure Synapse to listen
on JMS (refer notes below)</p>

<p>Configure sample Axis2 server for JMS (refer notes above)</p>

<p>Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService (Refer steps
above)</p>

<p>Configure JMS transport for Synapse (refer notes above - sample 110)</p>

<p>Start the Synapse configuration numbered 111: i.e. synapse -sample 111</p>

<p></p>

<p>To switch from HTTP to JMS, edit the
samples/axis2Server/repository/conf/axis2.xml for the sample Axis2 server and
enable JMS (refer notes above), and restart the server. You should now see
that the simple stock quote service is available over JMS as well at an
address as the one shown below, by looking at the WSDL of the service.</p>

<p></p>
<pre>jms:/SimpleStockQuoteService?transport.jms.ConnectionFactoryJNDIName=QueueConnectionFactory&amp;</pre>
<pre>java.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory&amp;</pre>
<pre>java.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:61616</pre>

<p></p>

<p>This Synapse configuration creates a proxy service over HTTP and forwards
received messages to the above EPR using JMS, and sends back the response to
the client over HTTP once the simple stock quote service responds with the
stock quote reply over JMS to the Synapse server.</p>
