      <p>
        The Synapse project will create a robust, lightweight
        implementation of a highly scalable and distributed service mediation
        framework based on Web services specifications.

	<section name="Introduction">
		<p>Synapse is a mediation framework for Web Services. Synapse allows messages flowing through, into, or out of an organization to be mediated, 	including aspects such as: </p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>      Logging, service lookup, performance mediation </p>
	</li>
	<li><p>      Versioning, failover, monitoring </p>

	</li>
	<li><p>      Fault management, tracing </p>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The user guide is available at <a  class="external" rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.apache.org/ws/Synapse/UserGuide">http://wiki.apache.org/ws/Synapse/UserGuide</a> </p>
<p>Synapse, incidentally, is pronounced "sine-apse", and not "sin-apse".  </p>
	</section>
	<section name="Status">

	<p>Synapse is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Web Services PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects 
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process 
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has 
yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
	<p>We have released a first Milestone M1. The release will supports: </p>
	<ul>
	<li><p> Simple mediation based on regex and xpath rules </p></li>
	<li><p> Onbound routing of messages </p></li>
	<li><p> Deploy simple Java mediators to perform logging, routing, message transform etc </p></li>
	<li><p> XSLT transformation of messages </p></li>
	<li><p> HTTP Proxy support </p></li>
	<li><p> Stages and in/out handling of messages </p></li>
	</ul>
