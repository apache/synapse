            <p>
                Apache Synapse is a lightweight and high-performance Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
                Powered by a fast and asynchronous mediation engine, Apache Synapse provides
                exceptional support for XML, Web Services and REST. In addition to XML and SOAP,
                Apache Synapse supports several other content interchange formats, such as plain
                text, binary, Hessian and JSON. The wide range of transport adapters available for
                Synapse, enables it to communicate over many application and transport layer
                protocols. As of now, Apache Synapse supports HTTP/S, Mail (POP3, IMAP, SMTP),
                JMS, TCP, UDP, VFS, SMS, XMPP and FIX.

            <p>
                Apache Synapse is designed to be lightweight and fast. The non-blocking HTTP
                transport, the multi-threaded mediation engine and the streaming XML infoset combine
                to ensure that Synapse can mediate very high volumes of messages through the service
                bus with minimum delay and resource usage. Synapse also comes with comprehensive
                logging capabilities, statistics collection and JMX monitoring support which are
                crucial in production deployments.
            </p>
            <img src="images/synapse-arch.png"/>
            <p>
                Synapse uses Apache Axis2 as the underlying Web Services engine. Therefore it
                has outstanding support for Web Services and related standards such as SOAP and
                WSDL. Tried and tested Axis2 modules like Apache Rampart and Apache Sandesha2 can be
                used with Synapse with no configuration overhead. Using such external modules,
                Apache Synapse supports a range of Web Services standards including WS-Security and
                WS-Reliable Messaging. Synapse also makes use of the Axis2 clustering framework to
                provide enterprise grade clustering support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Synapse is configured using a simple, XML-based configuration language. The
                configuration language and the related functional components are designed with SOA
                best practices in mind. It is trivial to store configuration fragments in an external
                SOA registry and import them to the mediation engine on demand. Synapse ships with a
                large collection of mediators that can be used to implement even the most complex
                enterprise integration scenarios. If necessary, the mediation engine can be extended
                by developing custom mediators using Java or your favorite scripting language.
