            <p>
                Apache Synapse build is based on <a href="https://maven.apache.org/"> Apache
                Maven 3</a>. Hence, it is a prerequisite to have Maven (version 3.2.0 or later)
                installed in order to build Synapse from the source distribution. Instructions on
                installing Maven 3 are available on the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/"> Maven
                website</a>. Follow these steps to build Synapse after setting up Maven 3.

                    the source
                    distribution, which is available as a zip archive. All the necessary
                    build scripts are included with this distribution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extract the source archive to a directory of your choice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run <strong>mvn clean install</strong> command inside that directory to build
                    Synapse. Note that you will require a connection to the Internet for the Maven
                    build to download dependencies required for the build.

            </ol>

                This will create the complete set of release artifacts including the binary
