                The file transport, also known as the VFS (Virtual File System) transport, can be
                used to read, mediate and write file content using Synapse. This transport allows
                Synapse to interface with the local file system and remote file systems via
                file transfer protocols such as FTP.
            </p>
            <p>
                The file transport is based on <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/">Apache Commons VFS</a>,
                and supports all the file transfer protocols supported by Commons VFS. This includes
                interactions with the local file system, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SFTP (i.e. file transfer
                over SSH).
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a fundamental difference between the file transport and transports such as
                HTTP, and it is important to understand this difference to be able to use the file
                transport correctly. The HTTP transport binds to a single protocol endpoint, i.e. a
                TCP port on which it accepts incoming HTTP requests. These requests are then
                dispatched to the appropriate service based on the request URI. On the other hand,
                the file transport only receives the payload of a message (i.e. the file), but no
                additional information that could be used to dispatch the message to a service. This
                means that file system locations must be explicitly mapped to services. This is done
                using a set of service parameters. For Synapse this means that the VFS transport
                listener can only be used in conjunction with proxy services. The relevant service
                parameters are specified in the proxy service configuration as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="xmlConf">&lt;proxy name=&quot;MyVFSService&quot; transports=&quot;vfs&quot;&gt;
    &lt;parameter name=&quot;transport.vfs.FileURI&quot;&gt;file:///var/spool/synapse/in&lt;/parameter&gt;
    &lt;parameter name=&quot;transport.vfs.ContentType&quot;&gt;application/xml&lt;/parameter&gt;
    ...
    &lt;target&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/proxy&gt;</div>
            <p>
                In the above example the file system location file:///var/spool/synapse/in is
                explicitly bound to MyVFSService. Any file dropped in that location will be
                pre-dispatched to MyVFSService, bypassing any other configured dispatch mechanisms
                that would normally apply to messages received via HTTP.

            <p>
                The file transport consists of a transport listener component and a transport sender
                component. Proxy services can read files using the file transport listener, and they
                can write file content using the file transport sender. Following sections describe
                how to configure these two components of the transport.
            </p>
            <subsection name="File Transport Listener (VFS Listener)" id="Listener">
                <p>
                    Before a proxy service can read files, the VFS listener must be enabled in the
                    <string>SYNAPSE_HOME/repository/conf/axis2.xml</string> file of Synapse. Look
                    for the following XML configuration in the axis2.xml file, and uncomment it if
                    it's commented out.
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;transportReceiver name="vfs" class="org.apache.synapse.transport.vfs.VFSTransportListener"/&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    To configure a proxy service to receive messages via the VFS listener (i.e. read
                    files from some local or remote location), set the "transports" attribute on the
                    proxy service element to "vfs":
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;proxy name=&quot;MyVFSService&quot; transports=&quot;vfs&quot;&gt;
    ...
&lt;/proxy&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    It's also possible to expose a proxy service on VFS transport and several other
                    transports. Simply specify the required transports as a space-separated list in
                    the "transports" attribute:
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;proxy name=&quot;MyVFSService&quot; transports=&quot;vfs http https&quot;&gt;
    ...
&lt;/proxy&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    A proxy service configured with the VFS listener, can be further customized by
                    setting a number of parameters (some of which are required). Following table
                    lists all the supported service parameters. Please refer <a href="../samples/sample254.html">sample 254</a>
                    for an example that demonstrates how to use some of these settings.

                            this parameter lets you configure the locking behavior on a per service
                            basis. Possible values are enable or disable, and both these values are
                            important because locking can be disabled at the global level by
                            specifying that at the transport receiver configuration (in axis2.xml) and
                            selectively enable locking only for a set of services. To configure
                            global locking behavior, set this parameter in the axis2.xml under the
                            VFS transport receiver configuration.

                        <td>
                            If this parameter is set to true, the transport will attempt to use a
                            javax.activation.DataSource (instead of a java.io.InputStream ) object
                            to pass the content of the file to the message builder. Note that this
                            is only supported by some message builders, e.g. for plain text and binary.
                            This allows processing of the message without storing the entire content in memory.
                            It also has two other side effects:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The incoming file (or connection in case of a remote file)
                                    will only be opened on demand.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Since the data is not cached, the file might be read several
                                    times.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            This option can be used to achieve streaming of large payloads. Note
                            that this feature is still somewhat experimental and might be superseded
                            by a more flexible mechanism in a future release.

                <p>
                    The file transport sender allows writing outgoing messages to local or remote
                    files. To activate the file transport sender, simply uncomment the following
                    transport sender configuration in the <strong>SYNAPSE_HOME/repository/conf/axis2.xml</strong>
                    file.

                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;transportSender name="vfs" class="org.apache.synapse.transport.vfs.VFSTransportSender"/&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    To send a message using the file transport, define a Synapse endpoint with an
                    address that starts with the prefix 'vfs:'. The rest of the address should be a
                    valid local or remote file URI. An example is shown below:
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;endpoint&gt;
    &lt;address uri=&quot;vfs:file:///var/spool/synapse/out&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/endpoint&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    Some more example file URIs are listed below. Remember to prefix each
                    URI with the string 'vfs:' when using these to define Synapse endpoints.

                <h4>File Locking <a name="Locking"/></h4>
                <p>
                    By default file locking is globally enabled for the file transport sender.
                    This behavior can be overridden at the endpoint level by specifying
                    <tt>transport.vfs.Locking</tt> as a URL query parameter with the appropriate value
                    (enable/disable) on a given endpoint:
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;endpoint&gt;
    &lt;address uri=&quot;vfs:file:///var/spool/synapse/out?transport.vfs.Locking=disable&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/endpoint&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    You may also change the global locking behavior by setting the <tt>transport.vfs.Locking</tt>
                    parameter in the file transport sender configuration in axis2.xml file.
                </p>

                <h4>FTP Passive Mode <a name="Passive"/></h4>
                <p>
                    When writing to remote file locations using a protocol such as FTP, you might
                    want Synapse to communicate with the FTP server in the passive mode. To
                    configure this behavior, simply add the query parameter <tt>vfs.passive</tt> to the
                    endpoint address:
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;endpoint&gt;
    &lt;address uri=&quot;vfs:ftp://myusername:mypassword@somehost/pub/downloads/somefile.tgz?vfs.passive=true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/endpoint&gt;</div>

                <h4>Retrying on Error <a name="Retry"/></h4>
                <p>
                    When the file transport sender encounters an error while trying to write a file,
                    it can retry after some time. This is useful to recover from certain types of
                    transient I/O errors and network connectivity issues. Following parameters
                    can be configured as URL query parameters on the file (vfs) endpoints to
                    make use of this feature.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>

                        <td>transport.vfs.ReconnectTimeout</td>
                        <td>
                            Time duration (in seconds) between retry attempts.
                        </td>
                        <td>No</td>
                        <td>30</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h4>Using Temporary Files <a name="transport.vfs.UseTempFile"/></h4>
                <p>
                    The file transport sender does not write file content atomically. Therefore a
                    process reading a file updated by Synapse, may read partial
                    content. To get around this limitation, the temporary file support can be
                    activated on the target file (vfs) endpoint:
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;endpoint&gt;
    &lt;address uri=&quot;vfs:file:///var/spool/synapse/out?transport.vfs.UseTempFile=true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/endpoint&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    This forces the file transport sender to write the data to a temporary file and
                    then move the temporary file to the actual destination configured in the file
                    endpoint. On most operating systems (e.g. Unix/Linux, Windows), this delivers the
                    desired atomic file update behavior. When the file endpoint points to a remote
                    file system, the temporary files will be created on the remote file system, thus
                    preserving the atomic update behavior.
                </p>

                <h4>Appending to Files <a name="Append"/></h4>
                <p>
                    When updating an existing file, the file transport sender usually overwrites the
                    old content. To get append behavior instead, set transport.vfs.Append parameter
                    on the target endpoint:
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;endpoint&gt;
    &lt;address uri=&quot;vfs:file:///var/spool/synapse/out?transport.vfs.Append=true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/endpoint&gt;</div>

                <h4>Out-only Message Exchange Pattern <a name="OutOnly"/></h4>
                <p>
                    It should be noted that by its nature, the file transport sender doesn't support
                    synchronous responses and should only be invoked using the out-only message
                    exchange pattern. In a Synapse mediation (sequence/proxy/API), this can be forced
                    using the following mediator:

                To avoid man-in-the-middle attacks, SSH clients will only connect to hosts with
                a known host key. When connecting for the first time to an SSH server, a typical
                command line SSH client would request confirmation from the user to add the
                server and its fingerprint to the list of known hosts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The VFS transports supports SFTP through the
                <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">JSch</a>
                library and this library also requires a list of known hosts. Since Synapse is
                not an interactive process, it can't request confirmation from the user and is
                therefore unable to automatically add a host to the list. This implies that the
                list of known hosts must be set up manually before the transport can connect.
            </p>
            <p>
                JSch loads the list of known hosts from a file called <tt>known_hosts</tt> in
                the <tt>.ssh</tt> sub-directory of the user's home directory, i.e. <tt>$HOME/.ssh</tt>
                in Unix and <tt>%HOMEPATH%\.ssh</tt> in Windows. The location and format of this
                file are compatible with the <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>
                client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the file not only contains a list of host names but also the fingerprints
                of their host keys, the easiest way to add a new host to that file is to simply
                use the OpenSSH client to open an SSH session on the target host. The client will
                then ask to add the credentials to the <tt>known_hosts</tt> file. Note that if
                the SSH server is configured to only allow SFTP sessions, but no interactive
                sessions, the connection will actually fail. Since this doesn't rollback the
                change to the <tt>known_hosts</tt> file, this error can be ignored.

                The VFS listener will start reading a file as soon as it appears in the configured
                location. To avoid processing half written files, the creation of these files should
                be made atomic. On most platforms this can be achieved by writing the data to a
                temporary file and then moving the file to the target location. Note however that
                a move operation is only atomic if the source and destination are on the same
                physical file system. The location for the temporary file should be chosen with
                that constraint in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                It should also be noted that the VFS transport sender doesn't create files atomically.
                Use the <a href="#transport.vfs.UseTempFile">transport.vfs.UseTempFile</a> endpoint
                parameter to get around this issue.
