/**
 * I/O dispatcher for incoming UDP packets.
 * This class is responsible for receiving UDP packets and dispatch
 * the processing of these packets to worker threads.
 * It uses a {@link Selector} to receive packets from multiple endpoints
 * and a {@link WorkerPool} to dispatch the processing tasks.
 * <p>
 * The dispatcher uses the following thread model:
 * Incoming packets for all the registered endpoints are received
 * in the thread that executes the {@link #run()} method. For every
 * packet received, a {@link ProcessPacketTask} instance is created
 * and dispatched to a worker thread from the configured pool.
 * <p>
 * The methods {@link #addEndpoint(Endpoint)}, {@link #removeEndpoint(String)}
 * and {@link #stop()} are thread safe and may be called from any thread.
 * However, to avoid concurrency issues, the operation on the underlying
 * {@link Selector} will always be executed by the thread executing the
 * {@link #run()} method. The three methods mentioned above will block until
 * the operation has completed.
