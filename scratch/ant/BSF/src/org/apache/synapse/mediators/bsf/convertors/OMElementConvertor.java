/**
 * The OMElementConvertor interface enables customizing the conversion of 
 * XML between Synapse and a script language. Some script languages have their
 * own ways of using XML, such as E4X in JavaScript or REXML in Ruby. But BSF
 * has no support for those so Synapse needs to handle this itself, which is what
 * the OMElementConvertor does.
 * 
 * Which OMElementConvertor type to use is discovered based on the file name suffix of 
 * the mediator script. The suffix is converted to uppercase and used as the prefix to 
 * the OMElementConvertor classname. For example, with a JavaScript script named myscript.js
 * the .js suffix is taken to make the convertor class name 
 * "org.apache.synapse.mediators.bsf.convertors.JSOMElementConvertor"
 * If the convertor class is not found then a default convertor is used which converts
 * XML to a String representation.
