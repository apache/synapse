completely on AXIS2.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Arial">A dummy service
called proxy has to be created for every Provider EndPoint. A provider giving
similar services at two locations say 2.1 and 2.2 need only create one proxy for
both the end-points. The details for the routing can be provided in the
broker-configuration.xml.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Arial">When a client
sends a request to the dummy/proxy service, it is received by the relevant axis2
listener and passed on to the transport and dispatchers. The custom modules
which provide the desired broker functionalities, as mentioned in the
broker-configuration.xml, are engaged on&nbsp; initialization. The modules pick
up the needed details from the xml file via a custom parser. The custom receiver
takes care of calling the relevant end-point as selected by say the routing
module/handler and makes the actual service call.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Arial">The links missing
are <b> dynamic disengage</b> and the capability to <b> engage modules at run-time</b> as and
when needed instead of at initialization. A small step towards these is provided
by using a active=true/false attribute in the xml file. The modules/handlers can
be made to perform logic/work only if the active state for them, with respect to
a particular service is true. Also if any change is made to the xml file after initialization,
we can hit the Adminservice and see to it that the changes are reflected. This
can be done using a listener also.&nbsp;</font> </p>
