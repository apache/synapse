Building Synapse from Source

The Synapse source code is available at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/synapse/trunk/java

To build Synapse, you will need JDK 1.5.x., Maven 2.0.6

The Synapse JARs could be built with Maven 2 as follows:

  mvn clean install

To build the Synapse distributions, first build the jars using the above and then use the following:

  mvn assembly:assembly -Drelease -Dmaven.test.skip

This will build the source and binary distributions in the target folder created.

To build the site, use:

  mvn site
