Apache Synapse 0.90 build  (November, 2006)

http://incubator.apache.org/synapse/
------------------------------------------------------

Apache Synapse is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Web Services PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects 
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision 
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability 
of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

-------------------
Documentation
===================
 
Documentation can be found in the 'docs' directory included with the 
binary distribution and in the 'src/site/resources' directory in the source
