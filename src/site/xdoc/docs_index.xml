  <p>
 Apache Synapse is a simple, lightweight and high performance Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) from Apache. Based on a small asynchronous core, Apache Synapse has excellent support for XML and Web services - as well as binary and text formats. The Synapse engine is configured with a simple XML format and comes with a set of useful transports and mediators. We recommend you start by reading the QuickStart and then trying out the samples.
