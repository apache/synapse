<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Sandesha2 gives reliable messaging capabilities to 
Axis2. From the point of view of the Axis2 engine, Sandesha2 is a module. When 
this module is engaged to a service, clients have the option of invoking it in a 
reliable manner. In the client side Sandesha2 module can be used to interact 
with existing reliable Web services. 

<p>According to the Web service-ReliableMessaging (WS-RM) 
specification which is implemented by Sandesha2, reliable communication happens 
between two endpoints. These endpoints are called the RM Source (RMS) and the RM 
Destination (RMD). Before communication, RMS and RMD perform a message exchange 
to create a relationship called a Sequence between them. A Sequence is always 
identified by a unique Sequence Identifier. 

<p>Each message of a sequence is numbered, starting from one. In
Sandesha2 the maximum number of messages a sequence can support is 2 <sup>64</sup>
(size of <em>long</em> 
data type). Of course practically this may be limited by the memory available 
for your system . The message number is used by the destination to support 
additional delivery assurances. This will be explained later in this tutorial. 

<p>The reliability is obtained basically using 
acknowledgements. RMS is required to send each message one or more times to the 
RMD. RMD sends back acknowledgements to notify the successful reception of 
messages. After receiving an acknowledgement for a certain message RMS can stop 
the retransmission of that message. 

<p>When all messages of a certain sequence have been 
successfully transmitted to RMD, RMS sends a TerminateSequence message. If RMD 
receives this message it can free any resources allocated for this sequence. 
Otherwise resource de-allocation will happen based on a timeout. 

<p><strong>Following diagram explains operation of the RMS
and the RMD</strong>.

<a>Sandesha2 supports two reliable messaging specifications. It
fully supports the WS-ReliableMessaging February 2005 specification and
February 2007 specification which was created by collaborative efforts
of several companies. </a>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p><img alt="Architecture" src="images/architecture.jpg">

<p>

<p>Sandesha2 components are used in a completely symmetric 
manner, in the server side and client as shown in the diagram above. Lets just 
consider a single side for this discussion.
<a name="hnd"></a>

<h3>Handlers</h3>

<p>Sandesha2 adds three handlers to the execution chain of 
Axis2. Two of these handlers are added to a special user phase called 'RMPhase' 
of in and out flows. The other handler is added to the predispatch phase of the 
inFlow. These handlers and their functions are given below. 
<p><img alt="Storage" src="images/handlers.jpg">

<a name="globalin"></a>

<h4>SandeshaGlobalInHandler</h4>

<p>This handler is added to the predispatch phase of the 
inFlow. Since this is a global phase, this handler will be called for each and 
every message that comes to the Axis2 system. To maximize performance, the very 
first function of this handler is to identify whether the current message can be 
processed by it. It checks whether the message is intended for a RM enabled 
service, and if so, check the message type to further verify whether it should 
be processed globally. This handler was placed to perform functions that should 
be done before the instance dispatching level of Axis2. 

<p><strong>Some of these functions are given below:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Detecting duplicate messages. 
  
	<li>Detecting faults that occur due to RM control messages and
	reporting them.</li>
</ul>

<a name="in"></a>

<h4>SandeshaInHandler</h4>

<p>This is added to the RMPhase of the inFlow. Since 
RMPhase is a user phase, this handler will only be invoked for messages that are 
aimed at RM enabled service. This handler processes the SOAP header of the 
message. Acknowledgement headers, Acknowledgement requests and sequence 
processing headers are processed by this handler. Sandesha2 has a special set of 
classes called message processors which are capable of processing each type of 
message. Depending on the type, the message is send through the 
'processInMessage' method of the message processor which will do the further 
processing of it.
<a name="out"></a>

<h4>SandeshaOutHandler</h4>

<p>This handler is responsible for doing the basic outFlow 
processing. This will first generate an ID called the Internal Sequence ID which 
is used to identify the sequence this message should belongs to. All the 
messages having the same Internal Sequence ID will be sent within a single 
sequence. An Internal Sequence ID will have a corresponding Sequence ID which 
would be obtained after the Create Sequence message exchange. In the client side 
the Internal Sequence ID is the combination of the wsa:To address and a special 
value given by the client called Sequence Key. In the server side the Internal 
Sequence ID is a derivation of the Sequence ID value of the messages of the 
incoming sequence. 

<p>Before sending the message through other handlers the 
SandeshaOutHandler will send it through the 'processOutMessage' method of the 
respective message processor.

<a name="rmm"></a>

<h4>RMMessageReceiver</h4>

<p>All the Reliable messaging operations 
(CreateSequence/CloseSequence etc) have the RMMessageReceiver as the ultimate 
receiver for the message. The RMMessageReceiver will identify the type of RM 
control message. Sandesha2 has a special set of classes called message 
processors which are capable of processing each type of message. Depending on 
the type, the message is send through the 'processInMessage' method of the 
message processor which will do the further processing of it.

<a name="sender"></a>

<h3>Sender</h3>

<p>Sender is responsible for transmission and retransmission of
messages. The Sender is a separate thread that keeps running all the
time. At each iteration Sender checks whether there is any messages to
be sent. If there is any, it is sent to the destination. Sender also
identifies messages that has to be retransmitted and keep re-sending
them until a maximum limit decided by <a href="userGuide.html#cs" target="_blank">Sandesha2 policies</a> is exceeded.

<a name="ioi"></a>

<h3>In Order Invoker</h3>

<p>InOrderInvoker is another separate thread that is 
started by the Sandesha2 system. This is started only if Sadesha2 has been 
configured to support in-order delivery assurance. InOrderInvoker makes sure 
that it invokes messages of a sequence only in the order of message numbers.
<a name="sf"></a>

<h3>Storage Framework</h3>

<p>Sandesha2 storage framework is one of the most important 
parts of the Sandesha2 system. This was designed to support the RM message 
exchange while being independent of the storage implementation used. The storage 
framework defines a set of interfaces and abstract classes that can be 
implemented by a particular storage implementation. Sandesha2 system comes with 
an in-memory storage implementation. There can be other implementations based on 
different databases and persistence mechanisms. 

<p><strong>Following diagram gives a brief view of the
Sandesha2 storage framework.</strong>

<p><img alt="Storage" src="images/storage.jpg">
<a name="RMbeans"></a>

<p>Storage framework defines several beans that extend the 
RMBean abstract class. They are given below: 
<ol>
	<li>RMSBean (fields - internalSequenceID, createSeqMsgID, 
  sequenceID, createSequenceMsgStoreKey, referenceMessageStoreKey, 
  securityTokenData, clientCompletedMessages, toEPR, soapVersion, replyToEPR, 
  rMVersion, acksToEPR, terminated, serviceName, pollingMode) 
  
	<li>SenderBean (fields - messageContextRefKey, 
  internalSequenceID, messageNumber, messageID, messageType, send, resend, 
  sentCount,timeToSend) 
  
	<li>RMDBean (fields - sequenceID, nextMsgToProcess, 
  pollingMode, referenceMessageKey, toEPR, replyToEPR, rMVersion, acksToEPR, 
  terminated, serviceName, pollingMode) 
  
	<li>InvokerBean (fields - invoked,messageContextRefKey,
	sequenceID, msgNo)</li>
</ol>

<p>There are four bean manager interfaces corresponding to 
each of above beans.They are as follows: 
<ol>
	<li>RMSBeanMgr 
  
	<li>InvokerBeanMgr 
  
	<li>RMDBeanMgr 
  
	<li>SenderBeanMgr</li>
</ol>

<p>Sandesha2 also defines a StorageManager interface that 
defines methods to create each of these bean managers and to create a 
Transaction object which should implement the Transaction interface. Transaction 
interface defines commit and rollback methods. The StorageManager interface is 
also responsible for storing, updating, retrieving and deleting of 
MessageContext instances for a sequence. 

<p>Collectively each Sandesha2 storage implementation 
should have following classes: 
<ol>
	<li>An implementation of the StorageManager interface. 
  
	<li>Implementations of the four Bean Manager interfaces. 
  
	<li>An implementation of the Transaction interface.</li>
</ol>

<p>These classes can be packed as a jar archive and added 
to the classpath. The name of the StorageManager implementation class must be 
mentioned in Sandesha2 policy configurations. This will be picked up after a 
restart of the the Axis2 engine.<br><br><strong><font size="4">InMemory 
Implementation<br></font></strong><br>As discussed, Sandesha ships with an 
InMemory implementation of the storage manager. Perhaps the most significant 
point of interest in this implementation is the transaction model. Transactions 
are scoped by thread: a transaction can only be associated with one thread ever 
and a thread can only have one transaction active at any single point in time. 
Any storage manager beans touched by the transaction will be enlisted into the 
transaction in such a way that any other transactions that attempt to touch the 
beans will block until the enlisting transaction completes (either commits or 
rollsback).
<a name="da"></a>

<h2>Delivery Assurances</h2>

<p>Sandesha2 can provide an in-order exactly-once delivery
assurance. The ordering (in-order) is optional. You can disable it using
Sandesha2 policy configurations. The ordering is done using the <a href="#ioi">InOrderInvoker thread</a> that was 
introduced earlier. 

<p><strong>If ordering (in-order) is enabled</strong>, SandeshaInHandler pauses the execution of an incoming 
application message. As a result of this, the message will not go through rest 
of the handler chain in the first invocation. Note that it also starts the 
InOrderInvoker thread if it is stopped. This thread goes through the paused 
messages and resume each of them in the order of message numbers. 

<p><strong>If in-order invocation is not enabled</strong> the SandeshaInHandler will not pause the messages and they 
will go in their full execution path in one go. 

<p>The delivery assurance to be used depends on your 
requirements. If you want the invocation to be as fast as possible, and you do 
not care about ordering, disable in order invocation. But if you want message to 
be invoked in the order they were sent by the client, you have to enable it. 
There could be a considerable performance improvements if this feature is 
disabled. Specially if majority of the messages come out of order. In the 
current implementation, each message (identified by sequenceID and message 
number) will be invoked only once. So exactly once delivery assurance is 
guaranteed. You cannot ask Sandesha2 to invoke the same message more than 
once.<br><br><font size="5"><strong>Configuring 
Sandesha</strong></font><br><br><a name="config"></a>Sandesha is configured using various means, and 
this configuration is made accesible in the SandeshaPolicyBean object, which is 
stored in the AxisDescription as a property at module init time. The 
configuration data can be loaded by examing the policies in the sandesha 
module.xml, from default values (if there is nothing in the module.xml) or from 
property files if explicitly driven by client code.<br>Some of the possible 
options to configure are: <strong>AcknowledgementInterval:</strong> time between 
sending acknowledgements<br><strong>RetransmissionInterval:</strong> time 
between retransmitting messages<br><strong>MaximumRetransmissionCount:</strong> 
max count to retry sending unacknowledged 
messages<br><strong>ExponentialBackoff:</strong> if true the time between 
message retransmission attempts will grow 
exponentially.<br><strong>InactivityTimeout:</strong> time that the sequence is 
allowed to remain inactive before it is cleaned 
up.<br><strong>SequenceRemovalTimeout:</strong> time to wait after a sequence is 
terminated before removing the sequence state from the 
store.<br><strong>InvokeInOrder:</strong> if true messages will only be 
delivered to the webservice endpoint in the exact order they were sent by the 
RMS.<br><strong>MessageTypesToDrop:</strong> the set of message types (stored by 
number, see Sandesha2Constants.MessageTypes) that are elligible to drop by the 
RMS.<br><strong>StorageManager:InMemoryStorageManager:</strong> the classname to 
use for the volatile 
storagemanager<br><strong>StorageManager:PermanentStorageManager:</strong> the 
classname to use for the non-volatile 
storagemanager<br><strong>SecurityManager:</strong> the class to use in order to 
process any WS-Security tokens associated with a sequence. A NO-OP 
implementation is shipped with Sandesha.<br><strong>ContextManager:</strong> the 
class to use to ensure the inOrderInvoker thread uses a specific context. A 
NO-OP implementation is shipped with Sandesha.<br><strong>EPRDecorator:</strong> 
the class to use in order to augment any endpoint references with any extra 
information required. A NO-OP implementation is shipped with 
Sandesha.<br><strong>MakeConnection:Enabled:</strong> if true, makeConnection 
messages will be used when sandesha is performing synchronous 
messaging.<br><strong>MakeConnection:UseRMAnonURI:</strong> if true, 
makeConnection messages used for synchronous messaging will use the RM anonymous 
URI.<br><strong>MakeConnection:UseMessageSerialization:</strong> if true 
messages are serialized into binary when sbeing stored in the 
storageManager.<br><strong>EnforceRM:</strong> if true any non-RM messages 
recieved by the RMD will cause an exception to be shown.<br>

<h2>Example Scenario</h2>

<p>This part explains how Sandesha2 framework works internally for
the most common RM scenario, which is the sending of a couple of Ping
messages from a client to the server. We will mainly look at how
Sandesha2 uses its storage to do the RM message exchange correctly.
While going through the following, keep the <a href="#RMbeans">RM
Beans and their fields</a> which were mentioned 
earlier, in mind.
<a name="cs"></a>

<h3>Client Side</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Client does the first fireAndForget method invocation 
  of a serviceClient after setting necessary properties. 
  
	<li>Message reaches the SandeshaOutHandler which detects 
  it as an application message. The processing is delegated to the 
  processOutMessage method of the Application Message Processor. 
  
	<li>Application Message Processor generates the Internal 
  Sequence ID as explained earlier. It understands that this is a new sequence 
  and generates a Create Sequence Message for it. The Application Message gets 
  paused. 
  
	<li>Application Message Processor adds an entry to the 
  RMS bean manager representing the newly created Create Sequence message. This 
  entry has three properties. The sequenceID property is initially null. The 
  createSeqMsgID is the message ID of the created CreateSequence message. The 
  internalSequenceID property gets the generated Internal Sequence ID value. 
  
	<li>Application Message Processor adds two entries to the 
  SenderBeanManager. One which has the send property to 'false' represents the 
  application message, other which has the send property to 'true' represents 
  the CreateSequence message. The Sender thread sends (and retransmits) only the 
  CreateSequence message. 
  
	<li>Application Message Processor stores three 
  MessageContext instances inside the StoreManager. The first is the 
  CreateSequence message, the second a "reference message", which is a copy of 
  the CreateSequence message. The third is the application message. 
  
	<li>After some time the client side would receive a 
  Create Sequence Response message from the server. The SandeshaInHandler 
  delegates the processing to the CreateSequenceResponse message processor. It 
  finds the correct CreateSequence manager entry using the 
  createSequenceMessageID property (which is in the relatesTo entry of the 
  response message). 
  
	<li>Client updates the sequenceID property of the RMS 
  bean manager entry. Also the send value of the application message entries are 
  set to 'true'. The sender starts transmitting and retransmitting application 
  messages. 
  
	<li>When the client receives acknowledgements for the 
  messages it send, they are delivered to the Acknowledgement Processor which 
  removes the corresponding application message entries from the Sender bean 
  manager. 
  
	<li>If an acknowledgement says that all the sent messages (up to
	last message) was successfully received, the Acknowledgement Processor
	creates a Terminate Sequence message and adds a corresponding entry to
	the Sender bean manager.</li>
</ul>
<a name="ss"></a>

<h3>Server Side</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Server receives a CreateSequence message. It 
  generates a new sequence ID and creates a new Create Sequence Response message 
  containing this ID. 
  
	<li>CreateSequence message processor processInMessage 
  creates an RMD bean representing the server side of the sequence. The sequence 
  identifier for this sequence is stored in the RMD bean and the bean is added 
  to the RMD bean manager. The initial value for nextMsgNoToProcess property is 
  1. 
  
	<li>The CreateSequence message processor starts the 
  "worker" threads for the sequence. This includes the Sender thread for 
  response messages and the Invoker thread if the StorageManager returns one. 
  
	<li>The CreateSequenceResponse message is created and 
  sent immediately by the CreateSequence message processor. 
  
	<li>After some time the server receives an application 
  message. The SandeshaGlobalInHandler retrieves the RMD bean which matches the 
  inbound sequence. A check is made to ensure this is not a duplicate message 
  before processing is allowed to continue. 
  
	<li>The server side SandeshaInHandler delegates this to the
	RMMessageReceiver which creates an acknowledgement message and sends
	it. If in-order invocation is enabled, an entry is added to the
	InvokerBeanManager representing this new application message.
	<p><em>Lets assume that the message number of this message is
	2.</em></p>
	<li>The InOrderInvoker which keeps looking at the 
  InvokerBeanManager entries sees that there are entries to be invoked. 
  
	<li>The InOrderInvoker checks the entry of the RMDBean 
  manager of the relevant sequence and sees that it is 1. But since only message 
  number 2 is present in the invokerBeanManager entries, the invocation is not 
  done. 
  
	<li>After some time, application message 1 also comes. 
  Now the Invoker sees this entry and invokes the message. It also updates the 
  nextMsgNoToProcess property of RMD Bean to 2. The Invoker again checks whether 
  the new entry for the nextMsgNoToProcess (2) is present in the 
  InvokerBeanManager entries. Since this is present it is also invoked. The 
  value is again updated (to 3) but no invocation is done since an entry is not 
  found. 
  
	<li>Some time later the server may receive a TerminateSequence
	message. It can partly remove the resources allocated for the sequence.
	The other part of resources (which is required by the InOrderInvoker)
	is removed after the invocation of the last message.</li>
</ul>
