<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Sandesha2 gives reliable messaging capabilities to Axis2. From the point
of view of the Axis2 engine, Sandesha2 is a module. When this module is
engaged to a service, clients have the option of invoking it in a reliable
manner. In the client side Sandesha2 module can be used to interact with
existing reliable Web services.</p>

<p>According to the Web service-ReliableMessaging (WS-RM) specification which
is implemented by Sandesha2, reliable communication happens between two
endpoints. These endpoints are called the RM Source (RMS) and the RM
Destination (RMD). Before communication, RMS and RMD perform a message
exchange to create a relationship called a Sequence between them. A Sequence
is always identified by a unique Sequence Identifier.</p>

<p>Each message of a sequence is numbered, starting from one. In Sandesha2
the maximum number of messages a sequence can support is 2 <sup>64</sup>
(size of <em>long</em> data type). Of course practically this may be limited
by the memory available for your system . The message number is used by the
destination to support additional delivery assurances. This will be explained
later in this tutorial.</p>

<p>The reliability is obtained basically using acknowledgements. RMS is
required to send each message one or more times to the RMD. RMD sends back
acknowledgements to notify the successful reception of messages. After
receiving an acknowledgement for a certain message RMS can stop the
retransmission of that message.</p>

<p>When all messages of a certain sequence have been successfully transmitted
to RMD, RMS sends a TerminateSequence message. If RMD receives this message
it can free any resources allocated for this sequence. Otherwise resource
de-allocation will happen based on a timeout.</p>

<p><strong>Following diagram explains operation of the RMS and the
RMD</strong>.</p>

<a>Sandesha2 supports two reliable messaging specifications. It fully
supports WS-ReliableMessaging February 2005 specification which was created
by collaborative efforts of several companies. Later this specification was
submitted to OASIS and currently being standardized under the OASIS WS-RX
technical committee. Sandesha2 supports up to the revision CD 3 of the
specification being developed under this technical committee.</a> <a

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p><img alt="Architecture" src="images/architecture.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>Sandesha2 components are used in a completely symmetric manner, in the
server side and client as shown in the diagram above. Lets just consider a
single side for this discussion.</p>
<a name="hnd"></a>

<h3>Handlers</h3>

<p>Sandesha2 adds three handlers to the execution chain of Axis2. Two of
these handlers are added to a special user phase called 'RMPhase' of in and
out flows. The other handler is added to the predispatch phase of the inFlow.
These handlers and their functions are given below.</p>
<p><img alt="Storage" src="images/handlers.jpg" /></p>

<a name="in"></a>

<h4>SandeshaInHandler</h4>

<p>This is added to the RMPhase of the inFlow. Since RMPhase is a user phase,
this handler will only be invoked for messages that are aimed at RM enabled
service. This handler will identify the type of this message. The type can be
an application message (a message that has to be delivered to the service) or
a RM control message. Sandesha2 has a special set of classes called message
processors which are capable of processing each type of message. Depending on
the type, the message is send through the 'processInMessage' method of the
message processor which will do the further processing of it.</p>
<a name="out"></a>

<h4>SandeshaOutHandler</h4>

<p>This handler is responsible for doing the basic outFlow processing. This
will first generate an ID called the Internal Sequence ID which is used to
identify the sequence this message should belongs to. All the messages having
the same Internal Sequence ID will be sent within a single sequence. An
Internal Sequence ID will have a corresponding Sequence ID which would be
obtained after the Create Sequence message exchange. In the client side the
Internal Sequence ID is the combination of the wsa:To address and a special
value given by the client called Sequence Key. In the server side the
Internal Sequence ID is a derivation of the Sequence ID value of the messages
of the incoming sequence.</p>

<p>Before sending the message through other handlers the SandeshaOutHandler
will send it through the 'processOutMessage' method of the respective message
processor.</p>
<a name="globalin"></a>

<h4>SandeshaGlobalInHandler</h4>

<p>This handler is added to the predispatch phase of the inFlow. Since this
is a global phase, this handler will be called for each and every message
that comes to the Axis2 system. To maximize performance, the very first
function of this handler is to identify whether the current message can be
processed by it. It checks whether the message is intended for a RM enabled
service, and if so, check the message type to further verify whether it
should be processed globally. This handler was placed to perform functions
that should be done before the instance dispatching level of Axis2.</p>

<p><strong>Some of these functions are given below:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Detecting duplicate messages and dropping them.</li>
  <li>Detecting faults that occur due to RM control messages and reporting
    them.</li>
  <li>Answering to acknowledgement requests of the dropped application
    messages.</li>
</ul>
<a name="sender"></a>

<h3>Sender</h3>

<p>Sender is responsible for transmission and retransmission of messages. The
Sender is a separate thread that keeps running all the time. At each
iteration Sender checks whether there is any messages to be sent. If there is
any, it is sent to the destination. Sender also identifies messages that has
to be retransmitted and keep re-sending them until a maximum limit decided by
<a href="userGuide.html#cs" target="_blank">Sandesha2 policies</a> is exceeded.</p>
<a name="mp"></a>

<h3>Message Processors</h3>

<p>Sandesha2 have a set of classes called message processors, each
implementing the MessageProcessor interface. Each message processor is
responsible for processing a certain type of message. For example,
CreateSequenceProcessor will process CreateSequence messages and
AcknowledgementProcessor will process Acknowledgement messages. The message
processor interface defines two methods for processing incoming messages and
outgoing messages. (namely 'processInMessage' and 'processOutMessage')</p>
<a name="ioi"></a>

<h3>InOrderInvoker</h3>

<p>InOrderInvoker is another separate thread that is started by the Sandesha2
system. This is started only if Sadesha2 has been configured to support
in-order delivery assurance. InOrderInvoker makes sure that it invokes
messages of a sequence only in the order of message numbers.</p>
<a name="sf"></a>

<h3>Storage Framework</h3>

<p>Sandesha2 storage framework is one of the most important parts of the
Sandesha2 system. This was designed to support the RM message exchange while
being independent of the storage implementation used. The storage framework
defines a set of interfaces and abstract classes that can be implemented by a
particular storage implementation. Sandesha2 system comes with an in-memory
storage implementation. There can be other implementations based on different
databases and persistence mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Following diagram gives a brief view of the Sandesha2 storage
framework.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Storage" src="images/storage.jpg" /></p>
<a name="RMbeans"></a>

<p>Storage framework defines several beans that extend the RMBean abstract
class. They are given below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>RMSBean (fields - internalSequenceID, createSequenceMsgID,
    sequenceID, createSequenceMsgStoreKey, referenceMsgStoreKey, securityTokenData)</li>
  <li>SenderBean (fields - messageContextRefKey, internalSequenceID,
    messageNumber, messageID, messageType, send, resent,
  sentCount,timeToSend)</li>
  <li>RMDBean (fields - sequenceID, nextMsgToProcess, pollingMode, referenceMessageKey)</li>
  <li>InvokerBean (fields - invoked,messageContextRefKey, sequenceID,
  msgNo)</li>
  <li>SequencePropertyBean (fields - sequencePropertyKey, name, value)</li>
</ol>

<p>There are five bean manager interfaces corresponding to each of above
beans.They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>RMSBeanMgr</li>
  <li>InvokerBeanMgr</li>
  <li>RMDBeanMgr</li>
  <li>SenderBeanMgr</li>
  <li>SequencePropertyBeanMgr</li>
</ol>

<p>Sandesha2 also defines a StorageManager interface that defines methods to
create each of these bean managers and to create a Transaction object which
should implement the Transaction interface. Transaction interface defines
commit and rollback methods.</p>

<p>Collectively each Sandesha2 storage implementation should have following
classes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An implementation of the StorageManager interface.</li>
  <li>Implementations of five Bean Manager interfaces.</li>
  <li>An implementation of a Transaction interface.</li>
</ol>

<p>These classes can be packed as a jar archive and added to the classpath.
The name of the StorageManager implementation class has to be mentioned in
Sandesha2 policy configurations. This will be picked up after a restart of
the the Axis2 engine.</p>
<a name="da"></a>

<h2>Delivery Assurances</h2>

<p>Sandesha2 can provide an in-order exactly-once delivery assurance. The
ordering (in-order) is optional. You can disable it using Sandesha2 policy
configurations. The ordering is done using the <a href="#ioi">InOrderInvoker
thread</a> that was introduced earlier.</p>

<p><strong>If ordering (in-order) is enabled</strong>, SandeshaInHandler
pauses the execution of an incoming application message. As a result of this,
the message will not go through rest of the handler chain in the first
invocation. Note that it also starts the InOrderInvoker thread if it is
stopped. This thread goes through the paused messages and resume each of them
in the order of message numbers.</p>

<p><strong>If in-order invocation is not enabled</strong> the
SandeshaInHandler will not pause the messages and they will go in their full
execution path in one go.</p>

<p>The delivery assurance to be used depends on your requirements. If you
want the invocation to be as fast as possible, and you do not care about
ordering, disable in order invocation. But if you want message to be invoked
in the order they were sent by the client, you have to enable it. There could
be a considerable performance improvements if this feature is disabled.
Specially if majority of the messages come out of order.</p>

<p>In the current implementation, each message (identified by sequenceID and
message number) will be invoked only once. So exactly once delivery assurance
is guaranteed. You cannot ask Sandesha2 to invoke the same message more than
once.</p>

<h2>Example Scenario</h2>

<p>This part explains how Sandesha2 framework works internally for the most
common RM scenario, which is the sending of a couple of Ping messages from a
client to the server. We will mainly look at how Sandesha2 uses its storage
to do the RM message exchange correctly. While going through the following,
keep the <a href="#RMbeans">RM Beans and their fields</a> which were
mentioned earlier, in mind.</p>
<a name="cs"></a>

<h3>Client Side</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Client does the first fireAndForget method invocation of a
    serviceClient after setting necessary properties.</li>
  <li>Message reaches the SandeshaOutHandler which detects it as an
    application message. The processing is delegated to the processOutMessage
    method of the Application Message Processor.</li>
  <li>Application Message Processor generates the Internal Sequence ID as
    explained earlier. It understands that this is a new sequence and
    generates a Create Sequence Message for it. The Application Message gets
    paused.</li>
  <li>SandeshaOutHandler adds an entry to the CreateSequence bean manager
    representing the newly created Create Sequence message. This entry has
    three properties.The sequenceID property is initially null. The
    createSeqMsgID is the message ID of the created CreateSequence message.
    The internalSequenceID property gets the generated Internal Sequence ID
    value.</li>
  <li>SandeshaOutHandler adds two entries to the SenderBeanManager. One which
    has the send property to 'false' represents the application message,
    other which has the send property to 'true' represents the CreateSequence
    message. The Sender thread sends (and retransmits) only the
    CreateSequence message.</li>
  <li>After some time the client side would receive a Create Sequence
    Response message from the server. The SandeshaInHandler delegates the
    processing to the CreateSequenceResponse message processor. It finds the
    correct CreateSequence manager entry using the createSequenceMessageID
    property (which is in the relatesTo entry of the response message).</li>
  <li>Client updates the sequenceID property of the CreateSequence bean
    manager entry. Also the send value of the application message entries are
    set to 'true'. The sender starts transmitting and retransmitting
    application messages.</li>
  <li>When the client receives acknowledgements for the messages it send,
    they are delivered to the Acknowledgement Processor which removes the
    corresponding application message entries from the Sender bean
  manager.</li>
  <li>If an acknowledgement says that all the sent messages (up to last
    message) was successfully received, the Acknowledgement Processor creates
    a Terminate Sequence message and adds a corresponding entry to the Sender
    bean manager.</li>
</ul>
<a name="ss"></a>

<h3>Server Side</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Server receives a CreateSequence message. It generates a new sequence
    ID and creates a new Create Sequence Response message containing this
  ID.</li>
  <li>Server adds an entry to the NextMessage Bean Manager. The initial value
    for nextMessageToInvoke property is 1.</li>
  <li>Server adds an entry to the SenderBeanManager (of server side)
    representing the application message. The send value is'true'. The
    CreateSequenceResponse message is sent by the Sender.</li>
  <li>After some time the server receives an application message. The server
    side SandeshaInHandler delegates this to the ApplicationMessageProcessor
    which creates an acknowledgement and sends it. If in-order invocation is
    enabled, an entry is added to the InvokerBeanManager representing this
    new application message.
    <p><em>Lets assume that the message number of this message is 2.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>The InOrderInvoker which keeps looking at the InvokerBeanManager
    entries sees that there are entries to be invoked.</li>
  <li>The InOrderInvoker checks the entry of the NextMessageBeanManager of
    the relevant sequence and sees that it is 1. But since only message
    number 2 is present in the invokerBeanManager entries, the invocation is
    not done.</li>
  <li>After some time, application message 1 also comes. Now the Invoker sees
    this entry and invokes the message. It also updates the
    nextMessageToInvoke property of NextMessageBeanManagerto 2. The invoker
    again checks whether the new entry for the NextMessageToInvoke (2) is
    present in the InvokerBeanManager entries. Since this is present it is
    also invoked. The value is again updated (to 3) but no invocation is done
    since an entry is not found.</li>
  <li>Some time later the server may receive a TerminateSequence message. It
    can partly remove the resources allocated for the sequence. The other
    part of resources (which is required by the InOrderInvoker) is removed
    after the invocation of the last message.</li>
</ul>
