<h1>UserGuide</h1>

<p>Apache Synapse is a mediation framework for Web Services. Synapse allows
    messages flowing through, into, or out of an organization to be mediated,
    including aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Logging, service lookup, performance mediation</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Versioning, failover, monitoring</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Fault management, tracing</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Although there is a clearly defined division between Synapse and Axis2,
    the Synapse system relies on Axis2 to run. Firstly, it uses the AXIOM object
    model, and secondly it uses Axis2 as a listener and sender for Web service
    requests. There are two ways to set up the Synapse server.</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>synapse.war : Deploy the WAR file into your favorite servlet
        container. Once it's expanded, you will see in <tt>WEB-INF</tt> the
        axis2.xml which has been configured to execute Synapse properly and
        synapse.xml, which will hold the rules pertaining to messages passing
        through Synapse.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>A lightweight server which runs with its own HTTP server : This uses
        Axis2's SimpleHTTPServer which is a simple lightweight HTTP server
        option
        that does not require a Servlet Engine. First unzip the
        Synapse-M1.zip. In the bin directory you will find scripts
        called:</p>
        <pre>synapse [.sh or .bat]</pre>

        <p>You should also see a directory called <tt>synapse-repository</tt>.
            There you will find the axis2.xml and synapse.xml config files. The
            axis2.xml need not be modified, but you can do so if you want to.
        </p>

        <p>The command line for synapse-lightweight takes the repository
            directory and listening port. Change directory to bin/</p>
        <pre>sh synapse.sh ../synapse-repository -p [Linux]

            synapse ../synapse-repository -p [Win]</pre>

        <p>which will start the SimpleHTTPServer at port 8080. If it's needed
            to be started at any other port use -p[port_number]. Ex:
        </p>
        <pre>
            ./synapse.sh ../synapse-repository -p5043
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that you can also build them using Maven: Build the WAR file by using
    the command,</p>
<pre> maven dist-bin</pre>

<p>This creates both the WAR and binary distribution JARs.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Deployment models</h3>

<p>Synapse can intermediate in a number of different modes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transparent mode
        <ol>
            <li>Synapse acts as an HTTP Proxy.</li>
            <li>Clients are configured with the Synapse endpoint URL as the HTTP
                Proxy URL.</li>
            <li>Synapse can work with both WS-A and non-WS-A SOAP messages.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Gateway mode
        <ol>
            <li>The client explicitly sends a message to Synapse (with or
                without
                WS-A headers)</li>
            <li>The synapse.xml must include enough routing information to
                correctly set the WS-A To and then Synapse forwards the
                message</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Smart client mode
        <ol>
            <li>The client sends the message to Synapse but sets the WSA headers
                to
                the ultimate destination</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Processing model</h3>

<p>Synapse has an overall model under which there are two ways to extend the
    framework.</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Using the SPI: Developers can build Synapse Extensions, which extend
        both the functionality and the XML configuration syntax of Synapse.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Using the API: Developers can build Mediators, which extend the
        functionality of Synapse but use the existing XML syntax.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>There are also built-in mediators that do common tasks like logging,
    redirection etc. Typically users of Synapse extend the function using
    mediators, while the Synapse development team can extend the core by
    building
    extensions.</p>

<p>A synapse deployment attaches to one or more transport listeners, and
    mediates messages from those listeners. One of the key decisions is how to
    "attach" mediators to messages.</p>

<h4>Rules</h4>

<p>By default Synapse will execute all defined mediators against a given
    message, but this can be affected by using simple rules. Synapse has two
    predefined rules: <tt>&lt;xpath&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;regex&gt;</tt>. xpath
    evaluates a XPath expression against the message, while regex matches a
    regular expression against one of the message headers (such as the
    <tt>wsa:To</tt> address).</p>

<p>Synapse also has two simple rules <tt>&lt;in&gt;</tt> and
    <tt>&lt;out&gt;</tt> which process only request or response messages (as
    seen
    by the target service).</p>

<h4>Stages</h4>

<p>As a message goes through the Synapse engine, it can pass through multiple
    stages. Each stage is a way of grouping and organizing mediators and rules.
    A
    stage simply gives the group a name.</p>

<h4>An example</h4>

<p></p>
<pre>&lt;stage name="stage1-all"&gt;
    &lt;!--This enables the addressing module which looks at wsa headers --&gt;
    &lt;engage-addressing-in/&gt;

    &lt;!--Logs the message --&gt;
    &lt;log/&gt;

    &lt;/stage&gt;

    &lt;stage name="stage2-service-specific" &gt;
    &lt;regex message-address="to" pattern="http://xmethods.*"&gt;
    &lt;header type="to" value="http://64.124.140.30:9090/soap"/&gt;
    &lt;/regex&gt;
    &lt;/stage&gt;

    &lt;stage name="stage3-send-all"&gt;
    &lt;send/&gt;
    &lt;/stage&gt;</pre>

<p>This example demonstrates <em>stage</em>, <em>regex</em> and some built in
    mediators: <em>log</em>, <em>addressing</em> and <em>header</em>. It does
    not
    demonstrate the <em>xpath</em>, <em>in</em> or <em>out</em> rules.</p>

<p>Every stage will be executed for each message. The first stage does
    initial processing including parsing the addressing headers and logging the
    message.</p>

<p>The next stage is using a regex rule to redirect every message addresses
    to xmethods.com and xmethods.net to the real SOAP address of the XMethods
    quote service.</p>

<p>Finally the last stage sends the message on. For responses, the messages
    come back through the same stages. This time the message will not be
    redirected because the "to" address on the response will not match
    xmethods.</p>

<h4>User Mediators</h4>

<p>Synapse allows users to extend the built in mediators and add their own.
    The mediators use the Synapse API. The API has three interfaces.</p>

<h4>SynapseMessage</h4>

<p>The primary interface is the <a>SynapseMessage</a> interface:</p>
<pre>public interface SynapseMessage {

    public SOAPEnvelope getEnvelope();
    public void setEnvelope(SOAPEnvelope envelope) throws AxisFault;

    public EndpointReference getTo();
    public void setTo(EndpointReference reference);
    // lots more header get/setters not shown
    // and a few other things ... see the real code

    public Object getProperty(String key);
    public void setProperty(String key, Object value);

    public void setResponse(boolean b);
    public boolean isResponse();
    }</pre>

<p>The <a>SynapseMessage</a> interface is based on the Axis2
    <a>MessageContext</a> interface. It uses the Axis2 <a>EndpointReference</a>
    and SOAPEnvelope classes/interfaces.</p>

<p>The purpose of this interface is to capture a message as it flows through
    the system. As you will see the messages are represented using the SOAP
    infoset. Binary messages can be embedded in the Envelope using the MTOM
    support built into Axis2's AXIOM object model.</p>

<h4>Mediator interface</h4>

<p>The second key interface for mediator writers is the Mediator
    interface:</p>
<pre>package org.apache.synapse.api;

    import org.apache.synapse.SynapseMessage;

    public interface Mediator {
    public boolean mediate(SynapseMessage sm);
    }</pre>

<p>The mediator can modify the <a>SynapseMessage</a> in any way it likes -
    adjusting the routing headers or changing the message. If it returns false,
    that signals to the Synapse processing model to stop processing further. For
    example, if the mediator is a security agent it may decide that this message
    is dangerous and should not be processed further. This is generally the
    exception as mediators are usually designed to co-operate to process the
    message onwards.</p>

<h4>EnvironmentAware</h4>

<p>The final aspect of the API is the <a>EnvironmentAware</a> interface. If
    the mediator implements this, then it will have the
    <a>SynapseEnvironment</a>
    injected into it:</p>
<pre>package org.apache.synapse.api;

    import org.apache.synapse.SynapseEnvironment;

    public interface EnvironmentAware {
    public void setSynapseEnvironment(SynapseEnvironment se);
    public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader cl);

    }</pre>

<p>The <a>SynapseEnvironment</a> allows the mediator access to the underlying
    engine:</p>
<pre>package org.apache.synapse;


    public interface SynapseEnvironment {
    public void injectMessage(SynapseMessage smc);
    public ClassLoader getClassLoader();
    public void send(SynapseMessage smc);
    public Processor lookupProcessor(String name);
    public void addProcessor(Processor p);
    public Processor getMasterProcessor();
    public void setMasterProcessor(Processor p);
    }</pre>

<h4>Mediator configuration</h4>

<p>Mediators can be configured in different ways which include</p>
<ol>
    <li>They can be loaded as simple classes:
        <pre>&lt;classmediator name="optional-name"
            class="org.apache.sample.MyLogger"/&gt;</pre>

        <p>This will load a class named <tt>org.apache.sample.MyLogger</tt> and
            use it to mediate messages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>As deployed Axis2 Services: This will direct the message through a
        deployed Axis2 service which implements the mediate interface:
        <pre>&lt;servicemediator name="optional-name" service="service-name"/&gt;
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Using IoC containers such as Spring: This model is supported by an
        optional extension, and requires that you have the <tt>spring-core</tt>,
        <tt>spring-context</tt> and <tt>spring-beans</tt> libraries from the <a
            href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring framework</a> website,
        as
        well as the <tt>springmediator.jar</tt> in your classpath. The Spring
        mediator model uses a spring assembly to configure an assembly of beans.
        The bean assembly must produce as one bean which implements the mediator
        interface.
        <pre>
            &lt;synapse-spring:springmediator name="optional-name"
            bean="name-of-bean-which-implements-mediator"&gt;
            &lt;beans&gt;
            &lt;bean .... spring bean assembly configuration goes here &gt;
            &lt;/beans&gt;
            &lt;/synapse-spring:springmediator&gt;
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>In and Out </h3>

<p>Redirection is only designed to apply to "in" messages by using the
    &lt;in&gt; rule. If we use &lt;out&gt; then you have to explictley use the
    &lt;in&gt; rule. </p>
<pre>&lt;stage name="stage1-all"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/stage&gt;

    &lt;in name="stage2-service-specific" &gt;
    &lt;regex message-address="to" pattern="http://xmethods.*"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/in&gt;

    &lt;stage name="stage3-send-all"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/stage&gt;</pre>

<p>There is a corresponding <tt>&lt;out&gt;</tt> rule.</p>

<h4>References</h4>

<p>In order to make the configuration more re-usable, every rule, stage or
    mediator can be named:</p>
<pre>        &lt;stage name="thisname"&gt;</pre>

<p>The name can then be used to "refer" to the mediator.</p>

<p>So</p>
<pre>&lt;ref ref="thisname"/&gt;</pre>

<p>will cause the same processing to happen as if the stage had been included
    at that point.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;in&gt;
    &lt;stage name="both"&gt;

    . . .
    &lt;/stage&gt;
    &lt;stage name="inonly"&gt; ...&lt;/stage&gt;
    &lt;/in&gt;
    &lt;out&gt;
    &lt;ref ref="both"/&gt;

    &lt;/out&gt;</pre>

<p>Please note this is one area where we expect to do considerable work</p>

<h4>Never</h4>

<p>This is a stage where none of the children get executed. Its purpose is to
    allow you to place rules and mediations and have them not executed but
    instead refer to them from one or more other places.</p>

<p>So the following may be deemed equivalent to the previous example</p>
<pre>&lt;in&gt;
    &lt;ref ref="both"/&gt;

    &lt;stage name="inonly"&gt; ...&lt;/stage&gt;
    &lt;/in&gt;
    &lt;out&gt;
    &lt;ref ref="both"/&gt;
    &lt;out&gt;
    &lt;never&gt;

    &lt;stage name="both"&gt; ...&lt;/stage&gt;
    &lt;/never&gt;</pre>

<h4>Content based routing</h4>

<p>We can further improve our example by adding some "content-based" routing.
    Using an &lt;xpath&gt; rule we can make tests within the XML. For example,
    we
    could decide not to allow stock ticker queries against certain companies
    whose share prices we were jealous of - MSFT say :-).</p>

<p>To do this we can add a rule:</p>
<pre>&lt;xpath expr="//*[Symbol='MSFT']"&gt;
    &lt;fault/&gt;
    &lt;/xpath&gt;</pre>

<p>This rule identifies any messages with a tag <tt>Symbol</tt> whose content
    is MSFT. The <tt>&lt;fault&gt;</tt> mediator returns a fault to the
    client.</p>

<p>We can place this rule under the regex rule, so it only applies to
    requests aimed at xmethods.*:</p>
<pre>&lt;regex message-address="to" pattern="http://xmethods.*"&gt;
    &lt;header type="to" value="http://64.124.140.30:9090/soap"/&gt;
    &lt;xpath expr="//*[Symbol='MSFT']"&gt;
    &lt;fault/&gt;
    &lt;/xpath&gt;

    &lt;/regex&gt;</pre>

<p>Note that the rules, like the stages, can have more than one child. While
    it isn't fixed in Synapse, the built-in rules and mediators all use the same
    "plan" to execute their children, which involves executing in the lexical
    order that they occur in the synapse.xml.</p>

<h3>XML Configuration Elements</h3>

<p>Every element in the Synapse configuration file maps to a instance of a
    Processor. There are two types of elements - <strong>nodes</strong> that
    "contain" sub-elements (ex: <tt>&lt;regex/&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;stage/&gt;</tt>
    and <tt>&lt;xpath/&gt;</tt>) and <strong>leaves</strong> which only contain
    configuration for that element or have no xml children (ex:
    <tt>&lt;engage-addressing-in/&gt;</tt>).</p>

<h4>Grouping and Referencing elements</h4>
<ol>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;stage/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;in/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;out/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;never/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;ref/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Rule elements</h4>
<ol>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;regex/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;xpath/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Built-in mediators</h4>
<ol>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;engage-addressing-in/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;log/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;fault/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;send/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;header/&gt;</tt></p>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;xslt/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>User mediator types</h4>
<ol>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;servicemediator/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><tt>&lt;classmediator/&gt;</tt></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Samples</h3>

<p><h4>Note:</h4></p>

<p><i>If you are running the samples using 0.94 distributions, please follow <a
        href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi" target="_blank">this</a> before running the samples.</i></p>

<h4>Logging</h4>

<p>The system ships with a couple of samples. These include sample clients
    and appropriate synapse.xml intermediary configurations.</p>

<p>The first sample demonstrates the logging facility. Here is a simple
    synapse.xml:</p>
<pre>&lt;synapse xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse"&gt;
    &lt;engage-addressing-in/&gt;
    &lt;log/&gt;
    &lt;send/&gt;

    &lt;/synapse&gt;</pre>

<p>The logging uses the Log4J/Commons Logging support in Apache. You can
    configure it using <tt>log4j.properties</tt>.</p>

<p>The sample client is a standard Axis2 client built to run against the
    XMethods Quote Service. However, it has been modified to use a different
    transport address from the Web Services Addressing TO header. In other
    words,
    the SOAP envelope is addressed to the XMethods service, but the actual HTTP
    request goes to Synapse. The sample client has three (optional)
    parameters:</p>
<pre>StockQuoteClient SYMBOL webservicexURL TransportURL</pre>

<p>e.g.</p>
<pre>StockQuoteClient IBM http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx
    http://localhost:8080</pre>

<p>The sample synapse.xml can be used to demonstrate a few simple behaviours.
    1) Firstly try this:</p>
<pre>StockQuoteClient IBM http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx
    http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx</pre>

<p>This will bypass Synapse and simply call XMethods.</p>

<p>2) Now start Synapse on port 8080 and try</p>
<pre>StockQuoteClient</pre>

<p>on its own. You should see the messages being logged as they pass through
    Synapse.</p>

<p>3) This time try</p>
<pre>StockQuoteClient IBM urn:xmethods-delayed-quotes</pre>

<p>This should hit a regex rule which replaces the "virtual URI" that is in
    the wsa:To header with the real URL.</p>

<p>4) Now try</p>
<pre>StockQuoteClient MSFT </pre>

<p>which should hit a "content-based" xpath rule.</p>

<p>ProxyStockQuoteClient illutstrates how Synapse working as Proxy</p>
